Network security stands as a critical aspect within the vast landscape of security concerns. In the digital realm where numerous individuals traverse shared networks, safeguarding sensitive information becomes paramount. The potential for malicious intent looms, with the risk of interception by rogue entities posing as legitimate network components. Once redirected, intercepted data falls prey to hackers who can clandestinely analyze it for valuable information.

This underscores the significance of encrypted communication, as any unguarded data intercepted by attackers—be it email passwords or credit card details—becomes vulnerable. Despite the advancements in contemporary network security, remnants of older, unencrypted systems persist, such as the widely known vulnerability of telnet.

While this project abstains from delving into ARP spoofing, it does focus on extracting information from unencrypted traffic. Notably, within the spectrum of secure email services, Sendgrid offers cutting-edge protection while also accommodating outdated, unsecured methods like telnet. The ability to create a free account facilitates exploration, allowing for the transmission of emails via telnet—a facet I've personally engaged with.
